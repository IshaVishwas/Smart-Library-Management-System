# Smart-Library-Management-System

This project is a Java-based Library Management System designed to manage and automate library operations for educational institutions. It features role-based dashboards for three types of users: Admin, Librarian, and Student.

The system allows administrators to manage librarian accounts, view reports on available and borrowed books, and oversee fine collection. Librarians can issue, return, and reissue books, calculate fines, and manage student borrowing records. Students can view their borrowed books, request new books, reissue books, and receive overdue notifications. 

The graphical user interface is built using Java Swing to provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience. All data, including books, users, borrowed books, and fines, is stored and managed in a MySQL database using JDBC for secure and persistent data handling.

Key features include:
- Role-based access with secure login for Admin, Librarian, and Student users.
- Book issuing, returning, and reissuing with real-time updates in the database.
- Fine calculation for overdue books with management and reporting features.
- Detailed reports of available books, borrowed books, and fines.
- User and librarian account management including password changes.

This system is designed as an educational project to demonstrate Java GUI development, JDBC database integration, and role-based application design.
